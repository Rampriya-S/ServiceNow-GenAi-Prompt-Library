As a platform admin, I want to create comprehensive documentation for the instance cloning process, which is divided into two stages. The first stage, 'Pre-Clone Preparations,' involves informing all developers, architects, and product owners to preserve their ongoing efforts, including update sets, integrations, and configurations. This stage also includes the scheduling process, which should be agreed upon by all product owners while considering upcoming releases. The second stage, 'Post-Clone Restorations,' focuses on restoring in-progress developments, integrations, remote instance setups, and other necessary components after the clone is complete.
